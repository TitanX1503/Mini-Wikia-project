    <p>The game would have begun with the player character in a prison cell. Because of this, the player was given a choice.
        The prisoner could be an innocent that was imprisoned because of some misunderstanding,
        or they could choose to be a criminal and take bonus traits that would bolster some of their skills.</p>

        <p>The player would awaken in a prison cell, but not the one they remembered falling asleep in.
            Suddenly, the floor rocks violently from an explosion and the player is knocked unconscious.
            When they awaken, they find their cell door open and a hole in the wall leading outside.
            Leaving the prison, the character is under attack by some unknown assailant.
            Deciding that discretion is the better part of valor, the player flees into the night to explore this new world.</p>

            <p>the project ended with the bankrupcy of Interplay and therefore, Black Isle Studios and the eventual bought from Bethesda,
