    <p>At the end of the original Fallout, the hero, the Vault Dweller, was exiled by the vault overseer for prolonged exposure to the outside world.
        Unable to return home, the Vault Dweller, with a group of willing companions, traveled far north. Eventually, they started their own tribal village called Arroyo in what we know as Oregon.
        Decades have passed since the original Fallout, and the Vault Dweller disappeared from Arroyo after writing their memoirs.</p>

    <p>In the time since the Vault Dweller's exile, a new government known as the New California Republic (abbreviated as NCR) has begun to unify the southern towns and is spreading to the north.
        A mysterious new organization known as the Enclave has emerged with the most sophisticated technology in the wastes, even surpassing the Brotherhood of Steel.
        A new drug, Jet, has become a burden on many towns, its addictive properties forcing many to rely on the town of New Reno to keep them supplied.</p>

        <p>During 2241, the humble village of Arroyo suffered the worst drought on record. Faced with this hardship, the village elder asked the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller, referred to as the Chosen One,
            to perform the quest of retrieving a Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K) for Arroyo. The GECK is a device that can create thriving communities out of the post-apocalyptic wasteland.</p>

            <p>The player, assuming the role of the Chosen One, is given nothing more than the Vault Dweller's jumpsuit, a RobCo Pip-Boy 2000 handheld device, a Vault 13 water flask, and some cash to start this quest.</p>
