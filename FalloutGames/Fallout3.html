        The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, retro-futuristic Washington, D.C. following the Great War between the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and other countries.
        The Great War occurred on October 23, 2077 which caused immense damage and destruction despite lasting less than two hours. Before the Great War,
        the Resource Wars nearly crippled the world and brought riots to the streets, during which the United Nations disbanded,
        and an F.E.V. (Forced-Evolutionary-Virus) plague coupled with global terrorism rendered the United States paranoid of both real and imagined communist plots.
        Canada was annexed by the United States in order to help the U.S. war effort against the Chinese in Alaska.
        The fact that Canada had the plentiful resources of nearly untouched wilderness made America's effort well worth the protection the U.S.A. promised to provide.

        The introductory sequence introduces the Lone Wanderer (player character) to their father, James, a doctor and scientist in Vault 101.
        James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother, Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6,
        which speaks of "the waters of life".
    </p>

    <p>
        The main quest begins after James leaves Vault 101, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid overseer to send his security force after the Lone Wanderer; forcing them to flee also.

        altought many of the original Fallout fans werent so keen on the idea of a 1st/3th person-action-RPG-FPS than on the original turn-based isometrical seen in the previous 2 games (as well as in Tactics and Brotherhood of Steel).
